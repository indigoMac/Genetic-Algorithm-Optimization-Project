# Genetic Algorithm Optimizer
## Overview
This project is a Python-based implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer. Genetic algorithms are a type of evolutionary algorithm and heuristic search method used in artificial intelligence and computing. They are particularly useful for solving optimization and search problems by mimicking the process of natural selection.

## Features
The Genetic Algorithm Optimizer in this project provides the following features:

- Optimization of a single numerical target.
- Optimization of polynomial coefficients.
- Various selection methods including roulette wheel, tournament, rank, and random selection.
- Adjustable parameters for mutation rate, population retention, and random selection probability.

## How It Works
The GA Optimizer simulates the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction to produce offspring of the next generation. The individuals in this context are potential solutions to the given problem.

### Key Concepts
- Individual: A potential solution.
- Population: A group of individuals.
- Fitness Function: A function that quantifies the optimality of an individual.
- Selection: The process of choosing individuals for reproduction.
- Crossover: Combining two individuals to create a new individual.
- Mutation: Introducing random changes to an individual's properties.

### Optimization Process
1. A population of individuals is initially created.
2. The fitness of each individual is evaluated based on a fitness function.
3. Individuals are selected based on their fitness. The selection process can be done in various ways, such as roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, etc.
4. Selected individuals undergo crossover and mutation to produce new individuals (offspring).
5. The new individuals form a new population, and the process repeats for a set number of generations or until a satisfactory solution is found.

## Usage
### Optimize a Single Numerical Target
The user can input a target number which the algorithm will attempt to reach through optimization.

### Optimize Polynomial Coefficients
The user can input a set of coefficients for a polynomial. The algorithm will attempt to optimize these coefficients to reach a target polynomial shape.

### Parameters
The user can adjust the following parameters:

- Population size
- Number of generations
- Mutation rate
- Proportion of individuals retained for the next generation
- Probability of selecting lower-fitted individuals
### Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Applications
Genetic algorithms are widely used in various fields for optimization problems, including:

- Engineering design and control
- Machine learning
- Economics
- Molecular biology
- Pharmacology
- Game development

## Conclusion
This Genetic Algorithm Optimizer serves as a practical tool for understanding and applying genetic algorithms to optimization problems. It provides a user-friendly approach to experimenting with genetic algorithms and observing their effectiveness in real-time.
